# Testing the GPT-5 API Fix

## What was fixed:
1. **Model Fallback Chain**: Now tries GPT-5 → GPT-4 Vision → GPT-4o
2. **Proper API Format**: Updated to handle both Responses API and Chat Completions
3. **Better Error Handling**: More specific error messages
4. **JSON Parsing**: Improved response parsing with fallback

## Quick Test Steps:

### 1. Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Multi-Tab Summarizer"
3. Click the refresh/reload icon

### 2. Test with Valid API Key
1. Click extension icon
2. Enter your OpenAI API key
3. Open 2-3 content-rich tabs (news articles, Wikipedia, etc.)
4. Click "Summarize All Tabs"
5. Check browser console (F12) for detailed logs

### 3. Expected Behavior
- Console should show: "Trying model: gpt-5"
- If GPT-5 fails: "Model gpt-5 failed: ..."  
- Then: "Trying model: gpt-4-vision-preview"
- Success: "Success with model: gpt-4-vision-preview"
- Sidebar should appear with summaries

### 4. Model Priority
The extension will try models in this order:
1. **gpt-5** (if available in your account)
2. **gpt-4-vision-preview** (fallback with image support)
3. **gpt-4o** (final fallback)

### 5. Check Console Logs
Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
```
Trying model: gpt-5
Model gpt-5 failed: gpt-5 API error: 404 Not Found
Trying model: gpt-4-vision-preview  
Success with model: gpt-4-vision-preview
```

This indicates the fallback is working correctly.

## Common Results:

### ✅ If you have GPT-5 access:
- Should work with gpt-5 using new Responses API
- Faster processing, better results

### ✅ If you don't have GPT-5 access:
- Falls back to gpt-4-vision-preview
- Still gets great results with screenshots
- Slightly higher cost but very reliable

### ❌ If still getting 400 errors:
- Check API key is valid and has credits
- Try different content (some sites block screenshots)
- Check browser console for specific error details

The extension is now much more robust and should work for most OpenAI accounts!
