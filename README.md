- Reload the extension after making changes

**API errors:**
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct and active

- Ensure pages have loaded completely before summarizing
- Try refreshing tabs if content appears blank

**Sidebar not appearing:**
- Check if the page allows content script injection
- Some secure sites may block extensions
- Try on regular websites first

## API Usage & Costs

This extension uses OpenAI's GPT-5 API, which charges based on:
- **Input tokens**: Text content and image analysis
- **Output tokens**: Generated summaries

Typical costs per tab summary:
- Text-only pages: ~$0.001-0.003
- Pages with screenshots: ~$0.005-0.015

The extension optimizes costs by:
- Limiting text content to 3000 characters
- Using low-quality screenshots
- Processing tabs in batches
